## 1.1. Introduction to linear systems

If you need to solve problems mathematically, you have to convert them to mathematical equations. This process is called mathematical modelling.

In equations, you will find various types of elements, they can be constants, scalars, symbols, variables, etc.For example, we may write an equation like멇롐뀛롐+洧녪洧녽=洧녫, where멇롐,멇롐마nd멇롐냭마re some amounts (say quantities of some items) and멇롐봑마nd멇롐붹마re variables (say item type).

That is an example of a**linear equation**망ith two unknowns멇롐봑마nd멇롐.

Another example, suppose we have three unknown variables멇롐,멇롐,멇롐망ith the following relationship:$洧녩洧논^2+洧녪洧녽洧녾=洧녫$.We cannot call this a linear equation because it contains the term which is멇롐봑raised to power two, and it also contains the product of terms멇롐붹마nd멇롐.

### What is a linear equation?

An equation is called**linear**말f each of the variables involved is of power one or power zero, not any higher or lower power, and does not have any terms made up of products of two variables. Further, the variables should not be raised to become the power of some base such as$洧^洧논$, which represents the exponential function.

A linear equation must contain at least one variable and have linear power, i.e., power one or zero. At least one of the variables must be of power one.

There are linear equations with many unknowns. As an example, analyse the following equation:

$$洧녩1洧논1+洧녩2洧논2+....+洧녩洧녵洧논洧녵=洧녪$$

Here we find the sum of멇롐1洧논1 and멇롐2洧논2맛p to멇롐뀛롐洧논洧녵, which is called a**linear combination**맖f the variables. The constant value멇롐맖n the right-hand side of the equation is the**constraint**맖n that equation. If멇롐말s zero, we call that equation**homogeneous**.

Therefore, in mathematical modelling:

1. we need first to identify the necessary symbols, variables, constants, constraints, etc.
2. afterwards, identify the relationships between them
3. then construct equations for these relationships
4. finally, solve them.

# Solving Linear systems
Linear systems can be solved using several methods. Here are some of the most common ones:

1. **Graphical Method**:
   - Plot each equation on a graph.
   - The point(s) where the lines intersect are the solution(s).

2. **Substitution Method**:
   - Solve one equation for one variable in terms of the other variable.
   - Substitute this expression into the other equation.
   - Solve the resulting equation for the remaining variable.
   - Substitute back to find the other variable.

3. **Elimination Method** (or Addition Method):
   - Manipulate the equations to eliminate one variable by adding or subtracting the equations.
   - Solve for the remaining variable.
   - Substitute back to find the other variable.

4. **Matrix Method** ([[Gaussian elimination]]):
   - Write the system of equations as an augmented matrix.
   - Use row operations to transform the matrix into row-echelon form.
   - Back-substitute to find the solution.

5. **Matrix Inversion**:
   - If the system can be written as \( AX = B \), where \( A \) is a matrix of coefficients, \( X \) is the column matrix of variables, and \( B \) is the column matrix of constants.
   - Find the inverse of \( A \), denoted as \( A^{-1} \).
   - Multiply both sides by \( A^{-1} \) to get \( X = A^{-1}B \).

6. **Cramer's Rule**:
   - Applicable if the system has the same number of equations as unknowns and the determinant of the coefficient matrix is non-zero.
   - The solution is found using determinants of matrices.
